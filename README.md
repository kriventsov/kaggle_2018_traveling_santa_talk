# kaggle_2018_traveling_santa_talk

This repository contains the slides of the presentation that I gave on January 24, 2019 for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LearnDataScience/">Learn Data Science meetup</a> in Vancouver. My presentation was about the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths">Traveling Santa 2018 - Prime Paths competition</a> on Kaggle, where I finished in the top 3% (47/1874). 

The competition was a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem. I believe that my presentation and video give a good idea of the modern approaches to this problem, especially those used by the participants of this competition.

The video of my talk can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0DYGBuUNDQ">here</a>.
